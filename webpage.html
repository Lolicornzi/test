			<h2>To begin , I find immense joy in indulging in my hobbies during my free time. One of my favourite hobbies is playing video games, and I often spend a significant amount of time immersed in virtual worlds. Lately, I've developed a liking for sports games like badminton, football, and ping pong, which offer a fun and competitive outlet. Additionally, I'm a music enthusiast, and listening to my favourite songs brings me unparalleled pleasure. One of my all-time favourite tracks is "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley, which happens to be playing in the background of this page. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Lastly, I have an insatiable curiosity to learn new things, and the elation I feel when acquiring new knowledge is simply indescribable. </h2>

        <h3>Kok is not just my best mate, but also my partner in crime when it comes to studying, gaming, and navigating through life's challenges. We've been together since our school days, living in the same residential area and sharing the same passion for video games. Our online chats and gaming sessions are a constant source of joy and camaraderie.

			One thing that sets Kok apart is his exceptional intelligence, especially when it comes to history. He's a whiz at the subject, always acing exams and impressing our teachers with his in-depth knowledge. Not only does he excel in history, but he also patiently guides me whenever I struggle with the subject, helping me overcome obstacles and develop a better understanding.
			
			Kok's dedication to learning and his passion for history never cease to amaze me. He's always reading up on historical events, discussing them with enthusiasm, and even sharing interesting trivia that I never knew before. His wisdom and insight into history have not only helped me improve my grades, but also fostered my own interest in the subject.
			
			But Kok's intelligence isn't limited to just history. He's a well-rounded individual with a keen mind and a quick wit. He's always up for a challenging debate or a stimulating conversation on various topics, and his perspective often brings a fresh and thought-provoking angle to any discussion.
			
			Beyond his academic prowess, Kok is a genuine and caring friend. He's always there to lend a helping hand, offer support, and provide words of encouragement when I need them the most. His friendship has been a pillar of strength in my life, and I'm grateful to have him by my side as we journey through school, gaming, and life together.
			
			In summary, Kok is not only a smart student with a knack for history, but also a compassionate and supportive friend. His intellect, wisdom, and unwavering friendship make him an invaluable asset in my life, and I'm grateful for the positive impact he has had on me.
